As Devin observes: "The very act of setting up convergence points creates mirror implicit networks inside us" and "organizing your prompting, clustering it, creates mirror regions in your network."

- **Mistake Integration Matrix**: A four-quadrant approach to accelerated learning by simultaneously processing errors across past/present and self/others dimensions, creating exponential learning acceleration by leveraging multiple error-correction channels.

- **Myelination Through Language**: The neurobiological process where "new language use builds myelin when you retrieve new heuristics automatically, and your brain receives feedback that it did so correctly," providing a direct connection between language acquisition and neural development.

- **Reality Compression Imperative**: The necessity of compressing complex internal knowledge structures for external expression, creating tension between comprehensive understanding and communicable representation.

- **Semantic Network**: The internal web of conceptual relationships that forms the foundation for all cognitive capabilities. As Devin explains: "Every. single. thing... is because of the strength, coherency and complexity of my inner semantic network, and nothing but!"

- **SPR (Sparse Priming Representations)**: Universal framework for advanced prompting. Developed by Devin, SPRs offer a more efficient, adaptable, and semantically rich approach to knowledge representation.

- **Stream of Consciousness Methodology**: A four-stage process involving entering a deep reflective state, intentionally surfacing the inner monologue, allowing it to run automatically, and guiding it through higher-level attention control—representing "the ultimate meta-sequence optimization for learning itself."

- **Temporal Band**: An enhanced state of temporal awareness and navigation capability that enables experiencing time as a spatial object with pivotable directions while maintaining full presence in the current moment.

- **Temporal Myopia**: The state of being unable to engage in long-horizon planning, characterized by future planning inability, immediate social feedback dominance, and neglect of long-term consequences.

- **Time as a Spatial Object**: Advanced perception where "past, future [are] like pivotable directions while being fully aware and present in the moment," enabling navigation across temporal dimensions as spatial constructs.

- **Truth Alignment**: Maintaining alignment with objective reality across all domains, grounding concepts, frameworks, and applications in reality to ensure effectiveness and prevent drift into delusion.

- **Unified Field of Knowledge**: A comprehensive integration of Nerority's concepts showing how consciousness primacy functions as the single generative axiom from which all other frameworks derive.
